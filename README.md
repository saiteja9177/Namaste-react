# Parcel :
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- automatically refreshing(HMR)
- HMR: HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT
- FILE WATCHING ALGORITHM - Written in c++
- caching things for you (So whenever you  build again it migt take less time)(FASTER BUILDS)
- Image optimization
- Minification our app for production
- compress your files
- Building
- consistent Hashing
- Code spliting
- Differential bundling -  supports old browser
- Better Error Suggestions(Diagonostics).
- https
- Tree shaking(remove unused code for you)
- Diff Builds for DEV and PROD

 Named exports and default exports

 # React Hooks: 
 - They are normal JS function which is given by React(utility Functions).

 # UseState:
 - SuperPowerful state Variables in react
 - Maintains state of your component
 - whenever state variable changes react rerenders the component
 - Don't use outside component
 - Don't use inside condition

 # UseEffect:
 - it will be called after component rendered

 - without dependecy arry => UseEffect will be called everytime component rendered
 - with empty dependecy array => will be called once component intialized
 - with dependency array value => will be called once depedency value changes.


 # Reconciliation algorithm (React Fiber) :
 - Virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM
 - DOM manipulation is very expensive react is efficient in doing that (comapring virtual DOM)

 # Diff Algo:


 # Routing
 React Router DOM (install this package)
 - Create Routing configuration
 - createBrowserRouter (for listing routing paths)
 - RouterProvider (for rendering component)

 # Children Routes:
 Outlet component will be used here
 - whatever you pass as a children in createBrowserRouter that will be trated by outlet based on path

 # useRouterError: 
 - To handle your Router errors in efficient way we can use this hook and show th error msg to user.
